<h1>Anonmaly Detection</h1>
<p>
Anomaly detection is a technique used in various fields to identify instances that deviate significantly from the norm or expected behavior within a dataset. The goal is to highlight patterns, events, or observations that are different from what is considered normal or typical. Anomalies, also referred to as outliers, may indicate potential issues, errors, or interesting events that require further investigation.</p>

<h3>Here are some common applications of anomaly detection:</h3>
<p><b>1.Network Security:</b> Detecting unusual patterns in network traffic that may indicate a cyber attack or security breach.</p>
<p><b>2.Fraud Detection:</b> Identifying unusual transactions or activities in financial transactions that could be indicative of fraudulent behavior.</p>
<p><b>3.Manufacturing and Quality Control:</b> Detecting defective products or anomalies in manufacturing processes to ensure product quality.</p>
<p><b>4.Healthcare Monitoring:</b> Identifying abnormal patterns in patient data that may suggest a health issue or the need for medical intervention.</p>
<p><b>5.Environmental Monitoring: </b>Detecting unusual patterns in environmental data, such as pollution levels, which could indicate a problem.</p>
<p><b>6.Predictive Maintenance: </b>Identifying anomalies in machinery or equipment data to predict potential failures before they occur.</p>
<p><b>Intrusion Detection in IT Systems: </b> Identifying unusual activities or behaviors in IT systems that may indicate a security breach.</p>
